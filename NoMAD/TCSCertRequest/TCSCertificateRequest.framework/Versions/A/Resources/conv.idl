**  NAME:
**
**      conv.idl
**
**  FACILITY:
**
**      Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
**
**  ABSTRACT:
**
**  Conversation Manager (conv) Interface.
**
**  This interface defines procedure that are architecturally defined
**  by the NCA datagram-oriented RPC protocol.  Calls to these procedures
**  are made by servers to clients.  I.e., an application client makes
**  a call to an application server and (sometimes) the application server
**  makes a call on one of these procedures back to the application client.
**  (The application server is thus transiently a "client.)
**
**  All application clients must be prepared to handle calls on this
**  interface.  (Note that these calls are typically transparently handled
**  by the client's runtime environment and not be the application client
**  itself.)
**
**  Note well that calls made on this interface are not "real callbacks".
**  (They're sometimes called "who-are-you [or WAY] callbacks".)  Whereas
**  the activity ID in the headers of packets that are parts of real
**  callbacks matches (i.e., must match) the activity ID of the surrounding
**  call, calls on this interface use a different activity ID.  This
**  is a requirement that arises from the fact that this interface is
**  used in maintaining "at most once" call semantics (i.e., protection
**  against duplication of datagrams) for calls to non-idempotent
**  procedures.
**

 * C O N V _ W H O _ A R E _ Y O U
 *
 * This procedure is called by a server to a client when the server has
 * just received a non-idempotent call request from a client about whom
 * the server knows nothing.  The server calls this procedure to determine
 * the current sequence number of the client (identified by its activity
 * ID) in question.  If the returned sequence number is higher than the
 * one in the request that prompted the "who-are-you" call, the request
 * must be a duplicated and is ignored.
 *
 * This procedure is necessarily (marked) "idempotent" since it supports
 * (and hence can not depend on) non-idempotent call semantics.
 *
 * It is expected (though not logically required) that servers will
 * maintain a cache of (client activity ID, current sequence number)
 * pairs to minimize the number of times this procedure needs to be called
 * by servers.  Cache entries can be dropped as is convenient to servers
 * since the cached information can always be re-obtained by making calls
 * on this procedure.
 *
 * The server passes its boot time back to the client to protect against
 * the case where the server receives a request, executes it, crashes
 * before sending the reply, and then reboots and receives a duplicate
 * of the request.  In this scenario, the rebooted server will necessarily
 * make a "who-are-you" call.  However, the input boot time will be
 * different and the client (processing the "who-are-you" call), which
 * will have saved the server's boot time from the "who-are-you" call
 * made by the previous incarnation of the server, will notice this and
 * return a non-zero error status to the server, prompting the server
 * to not execute the original request.  (Note that the client will still
 * not know whether the call was executed zero or one times, but all
 * we're promising is that it isn't executed more than once.)

 *
 * This is a newer version of "conv_who_are_you" and has a superset of
 * the older call's semantics.  The additional semantics are that this
 * call returns a UUID that uniquely identifies the client's address
 * space (CAS UUID).  The CAS UUID is used in cases where the server
 * is monitoring the "liveness" of a client which is not currently making
 * a remote call to the server (e.g., in case the server application
 * is holding state on behalf of the client and it wants to discard or
 * otherwise clean up this state if the client crashes).
 *
 * For compatibility with old clients, servers do not (should not) call
 * this procedure to get client sequence number information.  Rather,
 * they call this procedure if, in the course of processing a client's
 * call, they need the CAS UUID.  This procedure is constructed as a
 * superset of the old "who-are-you" to make it possible that some day
 * (or in environments with no old clients), servers WILL call this
 * procedure to get the client's sequence number (and hence avoid making
 * an EXTRA call to get the CAS UUID).

 * credentials are too large to fit within a single DG packet, the server
 * can retrieve the PAC, packet by packet, by repeated calls on this

 * the DG protocol (as opposed to being handled by a call executor thread),
 * there is no additional client overhead with retrieving the PAC by
 * multiple single-packet calls, rather than a single multiple-packet call.
 * The small amount of overhead induced on the server side is more than
 * compensated for by being able to avoid adding flow-control/windowing
 * to the DG protocol's internal handling of the conv interface.
