**  NAME:

**      ndrold.idl
**
**  FACILITY:
**
**      Network Data Representation (NDR)
**
**  ABSTRACT:
**
**  !---------------------------------------!
**  !-- THIS INTERFACE FOR IMPORTING ONLY --!
**  !---- DO NOT COMPILE THIS INTERFACE ----!
**  !---------------------------------------!
**
**  This local interface logically defines the data type "ndr_old_format_t"
**  (called "rpc_$drep_t" prior to v2).  The actual representation of
**  this data type is not expressible in NIDL since it is a struct that
**  uses bit field descriptions.  For binary compatibility with old
**  (pre-v2) stubs, we need to maintain the exact bit field representation.
**  The problem with not defining this data type in NIDL is that the
**  data type needs to be used in the definitions of other local
**  interfaces.  (These local interfaces are part of v2.) Prior to v2,
**  the way we solved this problem was to make the NIDL compiler treat
**  "rpc_$drep_t" as a builtin type.  This less-than-ideal solution was
**  not carried forward to v2.  Instead, we do something almost as ugly,
**  but which requires no hacks to the NIDL compiler itself.  What we
**  do is make local interfaces that need this data type import this
**  interface.  This makes use of this data type valid.  However, we
**  never actually run this interface itself through the NIDL compiler.
**  Rather, we make the build process substitute a hand-crafted "ndrold.h"
**  which contains the correct definition of "ndr_old_format_t".
